Using the previous code bits shown, develop an HTTP server that will:

- Consume Person structs via a POST request to /people
- Save the data in a map
- Retrieve and return the marshaled json for the appropriate person when firing a GET request against /people/{name}
- Write the data out to a file and return the marshaled json for all people with a GET request to /people
